All PyTorch model weights were used when initializing TFBertForSequenceClassification.

Some weights or buffers of the TF 2.0 model TFBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the PyTorch model and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights or buffers of the TF 2.0 model TFBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the PyTorch model and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some layers from the model checkpoint at indobenchmark/indobert-lite-base-p1 were not used when initializing TFAlbertForSequenceClassification: ['sop_classifier']
- This IS expected if you are initializing TFAlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TFAlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some layers of TFAlbertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at indobenchmark/indobert-lite-base-p1 and are newly initialized: ['classifier']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
